# Alexa Lambda Workshop
In this workshop we will build an Amazon Alexa skill, backed by an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), using multiple AWS services such as Amazon SES and Amazon Translate.

At the end of the workshop, you will have a voice skill that enables you to dictate short email to Alexa and send then to the recipient, using [Amazon Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), in the original language (English) or translate it to one of the 25 languages, supported by [Amazon Translate](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/).
